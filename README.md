🧠 Introduction

The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence and cloud technologies has transformed the way we approach interviews and skill assessments.
Traditional interview systems rely heavily on manual scheduling, question preparation, and evaluation — processes that are often time-consuming and inconsistent.

CrackIT AI: Real-Time AI Voice Agent Interview Platform solves these problems by providing an interactive, automated, and scalable solution using:

🗣️ VAPI for real-time voice AI conversations

⚡ Next.js for a responsive, modern UI

🔥 Firebase for real-time data handling and authentication

Currently designed for candidates to practice interviews in real time, this platform helps improve communication skills, confidence, and readiness.
In the future, recruiters will also be able to integrate the system for actual hiring workflows.

❗ Problem Statement

Existing interview preparation tools are limited to:

Text-based chatbots

Generic mock interview videos

Self-practice methods

These do not simulate the pressure and realism of a live interview, nor do they provide instant AI-driven feedback.

CrackIT AI bridges this gap by providing:
✅ Real-time, voice-based AI interaction
✅ Instant personalized feedback
✅ Scalable and accessible web-based platform
